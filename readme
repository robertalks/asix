*This driver has been verified on kernel versions from 2.6.14 to 3.8.0.*

==============================
Prerequisites
==============================

Prepare to build the driver, you need the Linux kernel sources installed on the
build machine, and make sure that the version of the running kernel must match
the installed kernel sources. If you don't have the kernel sources, you can get
it from www.kernel.org or contact to your Linux distributor. If you don't know
how to do, please refer to KERNEL-HOWTO.

Note: Please make sure the kernel is built with one of the "Support for
       Host-side, EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI" option support.


==============================
**Conditional Compilation Flag**
==============================

[AX_FORCE_BUFF_ALIGN]
Description:
       There are alignment issues of USB buffer in some USB host controllers.
       Turn on this flag if the implementation of your USB host controller
       cannot handle non-double word aligned buffer.
       When turn on this flag, driver will fixup egress packet aligned on double
       word boundary before deliver to USB host controller.
Setting:
	1 -> Enable TX buffers forced on double word alignment.
	0 -> Disable TX buffers forced on double word alignment.
Default:
	0


==============================
**Getting Start**
==============================

1. Clone the git repository

        [root@localhost ~]# git clone https://github.com/robertalks/asix.git

2. Now, change directory to asix where are the driver source which you need to build
 
        [root@localhost ~]# cd asix
			
3. Compile and install the driver. Make sure you have the kernel headers and sources
   avaiable.

        [root@localhost asix]# make && make install
 

==============================
**Usage**
==============================

1. If you want to load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and
   execute the following commands:

        [root@localhost ~]# insmod asix.ko

2. If you had installed the driver during driver compilation, then you can use
   the following command to load the driver automatically.

        [root@localhost ~]# modprobe asix

3. If you want to unload the driver, just executing the following command:

        [root@localhost ~]# rmmod asix
